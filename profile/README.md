# Project management templates 

👋 Hey, are you thinking about using GitHub to manage your project? Are you curious about how you can use GitHub to run kanban or Sprint style projects? This repo contains templates for both of these styles, and instructions for how you can re-create them with your ownorganisationn. 

* View the template for a sprint board [here](https://github.com/orgs/Project-managment-templates/projects/1/views/1).
* Instructions on how to create a sprint board [here](https://github.com/Project-managment-templates/Tasks/blob/main/recreate_sprint_board.md).
* View the template for a Kanban board [here](https://github.com/orgs/Project-managment-templates/projects/2/views/1)

These templates are currently managed by [Fionn](https://fionn.xyz/), i'd love to hear comments and suggestions for how to improve them! Ideally creating a set of best practice templates. The easist way to make suggestions is to open an [issue](https://github.com/Project-managment-templates/.github/issues).
